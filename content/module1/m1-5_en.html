Here are the key concepts to remember:</p><h2>What is GCDOCS?</h2><ul><li>GCDOCS is a new records and document management system that is being implemented government-wide.</li><li>It is a single, secure, and organized location for all the information you create and use.</li><li>Like a 'collective mind,' it allows you to save, find, and share information within your organization across all locations throughout Canada.</li></ul><h2>Why is it being implemented?</h2><ul><li>Older systems for storing information have led to a silo effectâ€”encouraging hoarding and duplication of information. GCDOCS fosters greater collaboration and sharing and paves the way for a new information culture in government.</li><li>A key goal of GCDOCS is to promote a more effective government by ensuring that information is: strategically managed, more accessible, better utilized, and easier to locate.</li><li>GCDOCS supports Canada's Action Plan on Open Government which has been launched to foster greater openness, accountability, and responsiveness.</li></ul><h2>How will you benefit?</h2><ul><li>In our digital age, we are overloaded with information that grows daily. Yet as a public servant, we are legally obligated to manage all this information. GCDOCS is designed to make this task easier.</li><li>Among other things, the system helps you: find information you need more quickly, easily identify final versions of documents, create more personalized filing plans, manage your email better, and avoid the needless duplication of information.</li><li>Most important, GCDOCS helps you share information and collaborate more easily with others across your organization anywhere in Canada.</li></ul><p><strong>Now that you understand what GCDOCS is and why it is being implemented, the next module gets you started using the system.</strong></p></div>
