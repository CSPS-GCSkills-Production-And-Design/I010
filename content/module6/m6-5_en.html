<p>Here are some important concepts to remember from this module.</p>

<h2>Managing versions</h2>

<ul>
	<li>GCDOCS allows you to track the versions of a document and determine: who created it, when it was created, and the version number. You can also&nbsp;<strong>Lock</strong>&nbsp;certain versions so they can't be deleted or purge older versions.

		<li><a href="#" onclick="fNav('m6-1-4'); return false;" title="How to lock a document">How to lock a document</a></li>
		<li><a href="#" onclick="fNav('m6-1-7'); return false;" title="How to adjust versioning">How to adjust versioning</a></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Emailing document links</h2>

<ul>
	<li>It is always preferable to send a document link rather than an attachment. This helps ensure that recipients always have the latest version.</li>
	<li>Sending a link also ensures that only users with sufficient permissions can access or modify the document. No more worrying about email attachments being forwarded to the wrong individuals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's next?</h2>

<p>Now that you've completed GCDOCS Fundamentals: Online Self-paced, be sure to review your Action Plan. This will help you get started with the systemâ€”reminding you of the many ways you can benefit from GCDOCS in your daily work.<br>
<br>
To prepare for the course Quiz, it's suggested that you:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Review the&nbsp;<strong>Key concepts and skills</strong>&nbsp;topic at the end of each module.</li>
	<li>Review "Easing the pains of information management" in this module.</li>
</ul>

<p>Good luck!</p>
