<p>No matter how hard Barbara works at organizing the file and folder structure in her current computer system, she still has difficulty finding important business documents.</p>

<p>Key business documents that she wants to access and share with others in her agency are mixed with other documents that have little to no value (such as copies of old meeting agendas and resumes of employees who have long since left the organization).</p>

The Enterprise Workspace in GCDOCS has a standardized folder structure that will remain stable over time. This will make it easy for Barbara to quickly find the information she requires. Also, because information stored in the Enterprise Workspace is regularly reviewed by her local records manager, Barbara will not have to worry about outdated information showing up in her searches. By using GCDOCS, Barbara will have access to the right information, at the right time.</p>
