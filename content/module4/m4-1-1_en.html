<p>The Quick Search function searches document titles as well as the content of items.</p>

<p>In Marc's case, Quick Search would have likely located the document containing an appendix with tips for time management.</p>

<p>No matter where you are in GCDOCS, the Quick Search function is always available to you. It searches the location where you currently are in the system.</p>

<p>For example, if you are viewing the entire folder structure within the Enterprise Workspace, Quick Search will search the entire Enterprise Workspace. However, if you are viewing a specific folder, Quick Search will just search the contents of that folder. Quick Search also permits you to use operators between keywords such as: "and," "or," or "not."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While items in your Personal Workspace are not generally accessible to others, they are still subject to the rules governing Access to Information, Privacy, and legal actions.</p>
