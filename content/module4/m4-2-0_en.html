<p>Once Marc has conducted his search for "tips on time management," a&nbsp;<strong>Search Results</strong>&nbsp;page is displayed.</p>

<p>As shown here, Marc's search has located two documents containing some or all of his keywords. To interpret these results, Marc looks at the&nbsp;<strong>Relevance</strong>&nbsp;score for each document.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<strong>Relevance</strong>&nbsp;score, represented by a percentage (%), tells Marc how relevant the item is to his keywords or search criteria (i.e., tips on time management).</p>

<p>The first document is 79% relevant and the second document is 73% relevant. Marc plans to have a closer look at the first document, "CSPS Leadership Resources" to see if it contains the tips he is searching for.</p>
