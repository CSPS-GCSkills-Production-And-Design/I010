			  <p>“For me, locating documents has always been frustrating. It’s about as much fun as a root canal.”</p>
			  <p>“Quite frankly, I am not the most organized when it comes to  filing and sharing documents. But the GCDOCS filing system makes it much easier to retrieve your documents. I find the GCDOCS search engine is really  powerful.” </p>
			  <p>“For example, working with others in GCDOCS, forces me to be  more organized. So it might take a bit longer at the beginning. However, in  return, I save a lot of time because I can locate things quickly and more easily  share my work.”</p>

        We are located in two different provinces with additional team members 
        spread out across the NCR. GCDOCS allows us to work efficiently from our respective locations.”</p>

		  <p>“The Wiki culture, being encyclopedic in nature, enables the community to share high-level information. This is an enormous advantage for many of our projects. For example, for some projects we might have to integrate systems from different companies across Canada, not all of which interact very well together.”</p>

      <p>“How annoying is it when someone keeps asking you for the same document you have already sent them five times?”</p>
      <p>“I work on a lot of presentations and reports that undergo constant change.
        I love the fact that I can send my boss or colleagues a link to my work so 
        they have access to the most recent version. Otherwise, I have to keep 
        re-sending large files, which is a waste of time and server space—not to
        mention the confusion that results when I send the wrong version. GCDOCS 
        helps me to keep everything organized and updated. I really appreciate the 
        “self-serve” model – I don’t have to keep asking my colleagues where things 
        are and vice versa.”</p>

        New employees joining a project can quickly find and review past decisions.
        New projects being initiated can benefit from lessons learned from past ones.
        And project managers can now track and control progress.”</p>
